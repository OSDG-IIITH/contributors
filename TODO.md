#TODO-LIST
Current Algorithm: persons contribution in a repo would be evaluated by the ratio of  sum of lines he/she has changed in the repo and total number of lines in it. Finally this ratio will be multiplied by the value of the repo, which may be given by stars or the number of contributors. A persons total contribution be then hence the sum of his contributions in all the projects he has yet worked on. This would be then updated on a regularly basis.

- Indentify amount of work, a person has done on a repo using the algorithm explained above. 
- Indentify if the repo is legitimate or not
- Should have a manual system for deleting a repo from ranking process.
- Write a setup script for the program
- Save the data in a html format(possibly first in a database)
