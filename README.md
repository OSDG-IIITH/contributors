OSDG Ranker
This is an application which ranks users on the basis of the amount of Open Source work they've done.Gsoc has always been a powerful motivator which inspires people to work in open source. The program invites students who meet their eligibility criteria to post applications that detail the software-coding project they wish to undertake. However,the program fails to motivate everybody to continue working after the termination of the program.So,  a need was felt for another motivation source, one powerful enough to keep people working in open source even after their project ends.Hence, we are creating this ranker which ranks people in relation to the work they have done. People may use this ranker to boast about their contributions to open source or compare them with their friends.This can increase their participation, making open source better.
