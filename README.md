# OSDG Ranker
This is an application which ranks users on the basis of the amount of Open Source work they've done. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) has always been a powerful motivator that inspires people to work in open source. The program invites students who meet eligibility criteria to post applications that detail a software-coding project they wish to undertake. However,the program fails to motivate everybody to continue working after the termination of the program. So, a need was felt for another source of motivation, one powerful enough to keep people working in open source even after their project ends. Hence, this ranker which ranks people in relation to the work they have done, therby gamifying contributions. People can use this ranker to keep track of their contributions to open source or to compare them with their friends.

The end goal is to increase participation, making open source better.
